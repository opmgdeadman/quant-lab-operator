# Quant Lab Engineering Continuation Ledger

Last updated: 2026-08-01
Status: ACTIVE
Authority: Sole canonical engineering continuation ledger

## Authority and Precedence

This file contains Quant Lab's accepted incomplete engineering work, queue precedence, one active job, and one current action.

No chat context, model memory, D1 continuation summary, runtime receipt, website state, operating-memory note, or other document may override this ledger.

The governing mission, operator authority, owner boundary, and operating doctrine are defined separately in `docs/QUANT_LAB_STARTUP_AUTHORITY.md`.

## Active Job

Job ID: `stage-3-baseline-strategy-bench`
Priority: 3
State: ACTIVE

Engineering objective:

Build and production-validate an immutable baseline strategy bench that measures simple, predeclared BTC-USD 1-hour strategies against fixed data partitions and the same cost and timing rules before any strategy factory or promotion system exists.

Accepted scope:

- predeclared, versioned baseline specifications with immutable hashes;
- buy-and-hold, simple trend, and simple mean-reversion reference strategies;
- fixed chronological train, validation, and test partitions with dataset hashes;
- cost-adjusted deterministic backtests using next-candle execution only;
- D1 persistence for baseline definitions, runs, metrics, trades, and artifacts;
- idempotent benchmark execution and reproducible result hashes;
- baseline comparison without tuning, promotion, or retroactive threshold changes;
- bounded operator controls and truthful website benchmark visibility;
- focused tests, CI, exact-SHA deployment, and production verification.

Out of scope for this job:

- strategy generation, mutation, or optimization;
- hostile judging or champion/challenger promotion;
- forward paper scheduling;
- leverage, derivatives, shorting, or complex execution;
- live capital;
- performance claims beyond the exact stored historical benchmark results.

## Completed Evidence

- Cloudflare Worker deployed and online.
- D1 binding connected.
- Authenticated MCP and bounded execution kernel operational.
- GitHub inspection, mutation, CI, deployment, migration, and production-SHA controls operational.
- Deterministic Python indicator, strategy-specification, backtest, and judge core present.
- `market_candles` and operator receipt tables present.
- Existing website can display the latest stored BTC-USD 1-hour candle.
- Quant Lab Startup Authority separated from this ledger at `docs/QUANT_LAB_STARTUP_AUTHORITY.md`.
- Mandatory startup context loads the full authority and this sole Git ECL before operator work.
- Every bounded operator intent requires the exact authority acknowledgment and this ledger's current Git SHA; skipped or stale continuity fails closed.
- Startup enforcement regression tests and parallel CI diagnostics pass on commit `b384e488a3689de65e1ac08859f0122fa990de7f`.
- Stage 1 market-data implementation now includes Coinbase Exchange BTC-USD 1-hour retrieval behind a provider boundary, completed-candle and OHLCV validation, immutable idempotent D1 persistence, gap/stale/error health state, bounded backfill, ingestion-run telemetry, protected manual execution, website health visibility, and hourly cron wiring.
- Deterministic Worker tests, quant-core tests, and Wrangler validation passed on implementation SHA `ee04077607be099a12206d1ecbb3121038d9ba7a`; D1 migration `0004_market_data_health.sql` applied successfully and that SHA deployed with repository/deployment alignment proven.
- Commissioning SHA `6203eed2b8183cb22024afe6147312cb05bceb25` passed all CI jobs and deployed successfully with bounded public health telemetry and corrected production phase labeling.
- Stage 1 reliability hardening added bounded provider retries, an exact BTCUSD Binance.US fallback for Coinbase availability failures, immutable provider-transition handling, and an authenticated receipt-backed production commissioning capability; Worker tests, quant-core tests, Wrangler validation, and exact-SHA deployment passed on `a7c6ac1a2f8e2d98e019dcf9e26afdd1115c8d58`.
- Production commissioning at `2026-08-01T17:34:27.981Z` recovered the missing `2026-08-01T17:00:00.000Z` candle and reported healthy state with zero staleness and zero gaps; an immediate repeat inserted zero rows and counted one duplicate.
- A real Cloudflare scheduled execution at `2026-08-01T17:35:41.000Z` completed successfully, preserved healthy state, inserted zero rows, and counted one duplicate, proving scheduler wiring and duplicate-safe operation.
- Stage 1 is complete. This transition restores the permanent `5 * * * *` UTC hourly cadence; longer reliability evidence continues as runtime observation and does not block Stage 2.
- Stage 2 implemented migration `0005_paper_execution_ledger.sql`, immutable orders, fills, cash entries, valuation snapshots, cycle receipts, mutable versioned projections, and a cycle-matching concurrency guard.
- The paper execution model is fixed as `paper-spot-next-eligible-open-v1` with 10 bps fees, 5 bps slippage, long-only BTC-USD spot, no leverage, no shorting, and no live-capital path.
- Focused tests prove next-eligible-candle timing, delayed-decision handling, pending retries, immutable replay, payload mismatch rejection, insufficient-cash rejection, oversell rejection, accounting conservation, malformed decision rejection, and version-conflict protection.
- Official CI passed and exact SHA `542ec6c7bd3bf9f9eea303d7b827f3c876ed4aad` deployed after D1 migration success.
- Production commissioning created one bounded paper buy and sell, then replayed both receipts without new effects. The final account has zero BTC, two orders, two fills, two cycles, reconciled cash ledger delta `0`, and no live capital enabled.
- Stage 2 is complete. The website and authenticated status now expose truthful paper-account state and reconciliation without publishing unsupported claims.

## Current Action

Inspect the existing strategy specification, backtest, hashing, indicator, and judge core, then define the immutable Stage 3 baseline catalog, fixed chronological dataset partitions, D1 benchmark schema, and idempotent execution contract. Use only predeclared reference strategies and prohibit parameter tuning or promotion logic.

## Exit Gate

The active job is complete only when:

- focused deterministic tests pass;
- official GitHub Actions validation passes;
- D1 migrations apply successfully;
- an exact commit SHA is deployed and verified in production;
- baseline definitions, parameters, partitions, cost model, and hashes are immutable and predeclared;
- repeated execution of the same benchmark creates no duplicate definitions, runs, trades, metrics, or artifacts;
- all baselines use completed candles and next-candle execution with the fixed fee and slippage model;
- chronological train, validation, and test partitions are disjoint, reproducible, and visibly hashed;
- no tuning, promotion, mutation, or threshold rescue occurs inside the baseline bench;
- website benchmark state reflects live D1 records truthfully and clearly labels results as historical paper research;
- no live-capital path is introduced or implied.

## Unified Job Queue

1. `stage-1-truthful-data-foundation` — COMPLETE
2. `stage-2-paper-execution-ledger` — COMPLETE
3. `stage-3-baseline-strategy-bench` — ACTIVE
4. `stage-4-hostile-strategy-judge` — QUEUED
5. `stage-5-controlled-strategy-factory` — QUEUED
6. `stage-6-champion-challenger-selection` — QUEUED
7. `stage-7-forward-paper-operation` — QUEUED
8. `stage-8-live-capital-qualification` — QUEUED

Only one job may be ACTIVE. New work must be inserted into this queue with explicit precedence rather than stored in chat or D1 as a competing continuation source.

## Completion Recording

For each completed job, record once:

- exact implementation result;
- validation evidence;
- deployed SHA when applicable;
- production verification;
- unresolved risks;
- next active job and current action.

Runtime measurements, cycle receipts, market data, trades, experiments, incidents, and website telemetry belong in D1, not in this engineering ledger.
